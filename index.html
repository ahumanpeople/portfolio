                As co-president of the ASME student chapter at San Francisco State, myself alongside our team of officers have been leading a couple of new initiatives to provide a diverse range of opportunities and events for engineering students at our university. We have massively increased outreaching and canvassing efforts on campus, resulting in increasing our membership numbers by more than double and maintaining high attendance for all of our events, regardless of their nature. Alongside this, we have led a more collaborative direction between student-led clubs on campus, as well as prioritizing community via hosting social events, creating a more active and interconnected environment for engineering students. Additionally, we’ve hosted a variety of different workshops and info sessions, inviting a diverse pool of companies to appease the wide interests of our student body.

                <br>
                As one of the outreach officers for the ASCE student chapter at San Francisco State, we prioritized reaching out to as many civil-related companies as possible to provide students with a variety of companies in different industries within the field for our school’s semiannual engineering career fair. I also helped maintain good relations with these companies, inviting top engineering firms such as McCarthy, PG&E, and DPR Construction to our campus for company info sessions. Additionally, we have been currently working with UC Berkeley to host the Mid-Pacific ASCE Student Symposium for April 2025, which involves contacting potential judges and communicating with other ASCE chapters.
